### VIM Editor {-}

The VIM (Vi IMproved) editor is a text editor for unix/linux operating systems. However, sometimes when using git commands the editor will appear. Examples of when it appears are during merges, or editing commit messages.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/git/VIM_editor.png")
```

One of the only commands you need to know with the VIM editor is how to save and close. To do so: hit the Esc button on the keyboard. And then type `:wq` to save and exit.
