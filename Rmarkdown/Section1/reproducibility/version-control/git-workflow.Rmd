### WorkFlow {-}

#### Download the code base {-}

Download the code base from the remote repository. This is called pulling. Navigate to the folder where the code base should be stored by using the `cd` command. 
  
`git clone path_to_repo`

#### Checkout a branch {-}

Checking out a branch is like opening a file. A branch is a group of files that are the "Saved As" version of the files on the master or develop branches.

`git checkout branch_name`

#### Make changes to the code base {-}

Edit your code. Remember to test the code before commiting it. Try to avoid commiting broken code!

#### Review which files changed {-}

We always want to review which files changed, to make sure we don't miss any changes that other code relies upon.

`git status`

#### Review changed files {-}

Review the changes. Imagine you had track changes on in Word and you can see the old and new versions. 

`git diff file_name`

#### Stage the file(s) for commitment {-}

`git add file_name`

#### Write a commit message {-}

Make the commit message short, and descriptive of the why, not the what! Remember that commits should be frequent enough that "and" isn't needed in the commit message

`git commit -m "commit message"`. 

#### Update remote repository {-}

Repeat all prior steps until you're ready to update the code on the remote repository.

`git push origin branch_name`

#### Pull Request {-}

Get another programmer(s) to review the code by submitting a code request to the develop or master branch.
TODO: Add more information about PULL REQUESTS

#### Checkout changed code {-}

Once the pull request has been accepted pull down the updated code from remote.

```
git checkout other_branch
git pull other_branch
```

#### Visualizing Git Flow {-}

```{r, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/git/git_flow.png")
```

#### In-depth development workflow {-}

1. A develop branch is created from master
2. Feature branches are created from develop
3. When a feature is complete a pull request is made for a potential merge into the develop branch
4. This request goes through a code review and can be approved/rejected by the technical lead
5. When develop branch is complete for a given cycle, a release branch is created from develop
6. When the release branch is tested and deemed ready for production it is merged into develop and master
7. If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
8. Once the hotfix is complete a pull request is made for a potential merge to both the develop and master.
