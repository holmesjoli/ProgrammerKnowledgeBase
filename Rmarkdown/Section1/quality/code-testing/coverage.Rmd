### Coverage {-}

In software development the term "coverage" is a measure indicating the amount of testing performed by test set.

Measuring coverage is helpful in several ways. 

First, the amount of coverage a package has is a useful indicator to other programmers about the quality of the package. If a package has high coverage, then it's likely a higher quality package as the majority of the code contained in the package is being tested appropriately.  

Measuring coverage is also very useful for developers. Coverage can help identify modules and functions in a package which aren't thoroughly tested.
