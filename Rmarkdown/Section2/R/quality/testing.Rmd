### Testing {-}

The most popular testing library in R is probably Hadley Wickham's testthat package.

Run the following code to automatically generate the `tests/testthat` directory. Test files like in the `tests/testthat` directory.

```
usethis::use_testthat()
```

The name of the file must start with test, e.g. `test_package.R`

Tests are organized hierarchically, expectations are grouping into tests which are organized into files

Tests should have descriptive names, so that the message associated with the test helps you to quickly identify the problem
