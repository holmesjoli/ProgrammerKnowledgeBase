### Data Archiving {-}

Please use the [dataArchiveR](https://github.com/holmesjoli/dataArchiveR) library. The dataArchiveR library is a library to help analysts link data and content. 

#### Workflow {-}

Develop code normally. Add and commit code to bitbucket/TFS and do pull requests. When it comes time to deliver content to a client/partner then use the dataArchiveR library. At this point the code should be code reviewed and tested and be ready to merge into master.

1. Pull request development branch to master
2. Checkout the master branch
3. Use the [Sample code](https://github.com/holmesjoli/dataArchiveR/blob/master/dataArchiveR/R/sample_code.py) to get started. Also, checkout the README and vignette for more information about the package and how the dataArchiveR packge can be integrated into a pipeline.
