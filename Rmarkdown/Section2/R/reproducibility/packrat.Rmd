### Environments {-}

There are several different methods to use environments with R:

* [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
* [Anaconda](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/)
* the appDependencies() function from RSConnect 
* [checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint)

This section will primarily focus on Packrat, which is maintained by RStudio. However, if you've read the [pyenvironment] section and found that method preferable, the same method can be applied to R. 

### Packrat {-}

Packrat is one way R users have developed to manage packages and R versions.

Packrat is:^[Text [from](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)]

* **Isolated**: Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because packrat gives each project its own private package library.
* **Portable**: Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.
* **Reproducible**: Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

#### Steps {-}

1. Initialize packrat 

**Current project**

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/packrat")
packrat::init(infer.dependencies = F)
```
Note: packrat can take a really long, sometimes frustrating long time to set-up all the packages. It's highly suggested to set-up the environment before starting a project and getting into the weeds. 

**New package**

While building your new package be sure to check the option highlighted in red:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/R_environments/new_r_package.png")
```

2. Save snapshot

Once all the necessary packages have been downloaded save a snapshot of the packages. Periodically update the snapshot when new dependencies are added.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
packrat::snapshot()
```

The snapshot will add the packages, versions, and package sources the the packrat.lock file.

3. Update environment

If you add packages after the initial snapshot is taken, then call the status and then take a new snapshot.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
packrat::status()
packrat::snapshot()
```

4. Share package libraries

There are two ways to share environments. One is through bunding and sending the bundle to a collaborator. The more preferred way is to use git to version control several files.

**Git**

Version control these files:

  * `packrat/init.R`
  * `packrat/packrat.lock`
  * `packrat/packrat.opts`
  * `.Rprofile`

This is the preferred method of sharing environments because everything can be stored in a version controlled repository and easily re-created.

**Bundling**

  * Run `packrat::bundle()`
  * Share the bundle with collaborators who have R. Collaborators will have to run `packrat::unbundle()` to access the code
	
5. Recreate the environment

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
packrat::restore()
```

#### Where are my project packages? {-}

Packrat downloads the project-packages into several locations

Base R packages: `Packrat/lib-R/32_or_64_bit_r/version_of_r`

Other packages: `Packrat/lib/32_or_64_bit_r/version_of_r`


#### Ignoring local repositories {-}

Unfortunately, packrat will throw an error for local packages which cannot be found on CRAN. 

Ignore local packages
```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
packrat::opts$ignored.packages(c("package1", "package2"))
```
