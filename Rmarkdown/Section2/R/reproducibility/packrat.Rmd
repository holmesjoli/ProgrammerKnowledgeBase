### Environments {-}

There are several different methods to use environments with R:

* [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
* [Anaconda](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/)
* the appDependencies() function from RSConnect 
* [checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint)

This section will primarily focus on Packrat, which is maintained by RStudio. However, if you've read the [pyenvironment] section and found that method preferable, the same method can be applied to R. 

### Packrat {-}

Packrat is one way R users have developed to manage packages and R versions.

Packrat is:

* **Isolated**: Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because packrat gives each project its own private package library.
* **Portable**: Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.
* **Reproducible**: Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

#### Initialize packrat with a current project {-}

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/packrat")
packrat::init(infer.dependencies = F)
```

Note: the github version is more up-to-date than the version of packrat on CRAN

#### Initialize packrat with a new package {-}

While building your new package be sure to check the option highlighted in red:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/R_environments/new_r_package.png")
```

#### Save snapshot {-}

Once all the necessary packages have been downloaded save a snapshot of the packages. Periodically update the snapshot when new dependencies are added.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
packrat::snapshot()
```

#### Where are my project packages? {-}

Packrat downloads the project-packages into several locations

Base R packages: `Packrat/lib-R/32_or_64_bit_r/version_of_r`

Other packages: `Packrat/lib/32_or_64_bit_r/version_of_r`

#### Sharing package libraries {-}

There are two ways to share environments. One is through bunding and sending the bundle to a collaborator. The more preferred way is to use git to version control several files.

#### Bundling {-}

1. Run `packrat::bundle()`
2. Share the bundle with collaborators who have R. Collaborators will have to run `packrat::unbundle()` to access the code
	
#### Git {-}

Version control these files.^[Sources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36187543/using-r-with-git-and-packrat, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/packrat-discuss/sm46dsvLxSk/wfz3hn840swJ, https://www.joelnitta.com/post/packrat/]

1. `packrat/init.R`
2. `packrat/packrat.lock`
3. `packrat/packrat.opts`
4. `.Rprofile`

#### Ignoring local repositories {-}

Unfortunately, packrat will throw an error for local packages which cannot be found on CRAN.
