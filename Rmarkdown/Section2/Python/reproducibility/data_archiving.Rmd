### Data Archiving {-}

Please use the [dataArchivePy](https://github.com/holmesjoli/dataArchivePy) library. The dataArchivePy library is a library to help analysts link data and content. 

#### Workflow {-}

Develop code normally. Add and commit code to bitbucket/TFS and do pull requests. When it comes time to deliver content to a client/partner then use the dataArchivePy library. At this point the code should be code reviewed and tested and be ready to merge into master.

1. Pull request development branch to master
2. Checkout the master branch
3. Use the [Sample code](https://github.com/holmesjoli/dataArchivePy/blob/master/dataArchivePy/sample_code.py) and auto_commit modules and archive_files modules to commit and archive data and other content.
