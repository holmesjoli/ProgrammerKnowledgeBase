### Environments {- #pyenvironment}

#### Package and environment managers {-}

Most popular python tools for virtual environments:

* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): Python package manager; funnily enough, it stands for "Pip Installs Packages"") 
* [Conda](https://conda.io/): Package and environment manager

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/python_environments/conda_env.png")
```

#### Conda Environment {- #condaenvironment}

A conda environment is container that holds a specific version of the source software and packages.

#### Setting Up a Conda Environment {-}

1. Open Git Bash
2. Create a new environment by typing `conda create --name NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT`. Adding `python=3.7` or `python=2.7` specificies which python to install. If No version is specified, the root version will be used.		3. Install the packages into the environment. Type `conda install numpy`. Package versions can be specified by adding `numpy==1.11` or` numpy>=1.11`
4. Save the environment so others can replicate it. Type `conda list -e > requirements.txt`. Version control the requirements file. Now others be able to build your exact environment, helping to mitigate python and package version issues 

#### Use an already created conda environment {-}

1. To see what environments exist type `conda env list`. The asterisk (*) indicates the current active environment 
2. Activate the environment of interest. `source activate NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT`. Activating the environment allows access to the version of python and all the packages installed in that environment
	
#### Copy an environment {-}

1. Using the requirements.text file type `conda create --name NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT --file requirements.txt`
2. Activate the environment by typing `source activate NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT`

#### Deleting an environment {-}

1. `conda remove --name NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT --all`
